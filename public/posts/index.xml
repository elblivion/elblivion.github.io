      <description>In this meta-post, I describe how I returned to my abandoned blog and how I set it up.
After many years without posting I decided to revive and revamp this blog. A big factor in this was the trouble a friend of mine had with their LinkedIn account; it made me realise that large social media companies essentially own and control the content you put on them, so &amp;ldquo;LinkedIn Posts&amp;rdquo; or Medium or what have you are no replacement for having control over what you write.</description>

      <title>Slimmer Ubuntu PPA in docker</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Many of my Docker images for testing software for production are based on Ubuntu, because that&amp;rsquo;s  what we use in production and while I love Alpine Linux-based images it&amp;rsquo;s  just too much overhead, not to mention self-defeating, to be hunting for equivalent packages all the time in a different distro and dealing with dynamic linking issues. Still, that image size tho!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Adventures in User-Data</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of my first tasks at my current employer was to automate bootstrapping of our AWS EC2 instances: to get them in a state where Chef could run on them without having to do any manual fiddling after launch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To achieve this two things were needed, both requiring a lot of trial and error: an &lt;a href=&#34;http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use_switch-role-ec2.html&#34;&gt;IAM instance profile&lt;/a&gt; to let EC2 instances access other AWS resources without having to distribute API keys, and a &lt;a href=&#34;http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/user-data.html#user-data-shell-scripts&#34;&gt;User-Data script&lt;/a&gt;, which is a shell script that is run automatically on boot to set up. This is part of &lt;a href=&#34;http://cloudinit.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html&#34;&gt;Cloud-init&lt;/a&gt;, a standard for early initialisation of cloud instances.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
